## Usage

Before using any of these utilities, you should check if your linux kernel as well as your hardware/development board support **configuring USB Hid gadget through configfs**.

Try finding the mount point of configfs:

```bash
sudo mount -l | grep configfs
```

if it outputs the mount point of configfs, go ahead; 

otherwise try load kernel module and mount it:

```bash
sudo modprobe libcomposite
CONFIGFS_HOME=XXX
mount none $CONFIGFS_HOME -t configfs
```

and then retry the first command.

If the output is still empty, you may need to modify kernel settings and compile the kernel.

If folder `usb_gadget` doesn't exist in `$CONFIGFS_HOME`, you also need to modify kernel settings and compile the kernel.

### desc2bin

1. First download [Hid-Descriptor-Tool](https://www.usb.org/document-library/hid-descriptor-tool) on a **Windows PC**, unzip and run Dt.exe. Edit your own hid descriptor or select one from the given samples along with the tool. Click "File-SaveAs" and export the descriptor to a C header file (.h).
2. Upload the header file to your linux board. Within the desc2bin folder, mouseDesc.h and keybrdDesc.h are provided for reference or tests.

3. Then run the convert.sh script to convert the header file to required binary file. 
    ```bash
    cd desc2bin
    sudo chmod +x ./convert.sh #if necessary
    ./convert.sh mouseDesc.h mouse-descriptor.bin
    ```

4. If all goes well, a binary file mouse-descriptor.bin will be generated in current folder, command `hexdump` is useful to check its content:

    ```bash
    hexdump mouse-descriptor.bin
    ```

You can replace the header file and output binary file name in commands above, as you need. The binary file is required in next step.

### setup_script

1. Open the `en_gadget.sh` using your favourite editor.

2. Edit the Settings between `####[ User Settings begin]#####` and `####[ User Settings end]#####`, referring to the comments following the keys. 

3. Delete or append lines of `function_setup` in `main()`, according to your number of functions.

4. Save and Close.

5. Run the shellscript with sudo:

    ```bash
    cd setup_script
    sudo chmod +x ./en_gadget.sh
    sudo ./en_gadget.sh
    ```

If the scipt print the device file like `/dev/hidg0`, `/dev/hidg1` in the end, the gadget has been set up properly.

Note: the script DOES NOT handle any error occurred halfway, you may better look through the script and make clear exactly what it will do before execution.

### driver_sample

**After gadget setup**, `hid_gadget_test.c` could be used to test the hid functions interactively.

1. Assure you have properly set up usb hid gadget in previous steps.

2. Compile the c source file.

    ```bash
    cd driver_sample
    gcc hid_gadget_test.c -o hid_gadget_test
    ```

2. Connect the device to your host PC(or other host devices) using a USB cable.

    If there is multiple USB ports on device, you need to make sure you connected the right one.

3. If the host PC has a operating system, check the Device Manager to see if the device is recognized properly as a USB device.

4. Run the program to emulate a keyboard:

    ```bash
    ./hid_gadget /dev/hidgX keyboard
    ```

    Where X should be replaced by your real device number printed in last step, and "keyboard" could also be replaced by "mouse" to emulate a mouse.

5. The program will print all the commands that is supported. For example, type`--left-meta e` and press Enter, the host PC will open explorer if running Windows system.

### python_wrap

This is a wrapper class of the given sample program for controlling the gadget in your own python program.

1. Assure you have properly set up usb hid gadget in previous steps.

2. Compile the sample program to dynamic library.

    ```bash
    cd python_wrap
    sudo chmod +x ./get_so.sh
    ./get_so.sh
    ```

    Then `gadget.so` should be compiled in current folder.

3. Import gadget and write your python code . For example:

    ```python
    from gadget import Gadget
    gkey=Gadget("/dev/hidg0","keyboard")
    gms=Gadget("/dev/hidg1","mouse")
    
    gkey.send("--left-meta e")   # win+e
    gms.send("-65 -65 --b2")     # move left-up and right click
    ```
